Paging
Paging is a memory management technique that divides physical memory into fixed-sized 
blocks called frames and logical memory into pages of the same size. 
This eliminates external fragmentation and allows processes to be stored in non-contiguous memory locations.

Segmentation
Segmentation is a memory management technique that divides a process into variable-sized segments,
each representing a logical unit (e.g., code, data, stack). Unlike paging, segmentation maintains 
logical separation of program components.


Virtual memory : is a memory management technique that allows a computer to execute processes larger than
the available physical RAM by using disk storage (swap space) as an extension of RAM.
Page Replacement: If RAM is full, the OS replaces least-used pages with new ones (e.g., LRU - Least Recently Used algorithm).

A page fault occurs when a program accesses a page in virtual memory that is not currently mapped to physical memory (RAM). 
The operating system (OS) then has to retrieve the required page from disk (or another source) and map it into RAM before 
the program can continue executing.
