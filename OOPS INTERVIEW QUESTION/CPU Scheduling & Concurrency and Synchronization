No preemption" in an operating system (OS) means that a process currently holding a resource 
cannot be forcefully taken away from it by the OS; 
the process must voluntarily release the resource when it finishes using it

FCFS( first come first serve)
Shortest job first ( process with shortest burst time is executed first)
Round Robin ( each process gets a fixed time , if it doesnt complete , it gets moved back to the queue)

Starvation occurs when a process in the OS runs out of resources because other processes are using it.
his is a problem with resource management while Operating systems employ aging as a scheduling approach to keep them from starving. 

The principles of Ageing, where a processâ€™s priority increases the longer it waits to prevent starvation, 
should be included in the resource allocation priority system.

Deadlock occurs when none of the processes in the set is able to move ahead due to occupancy of the required 
resources by some other process as shown in the figure below, on the other hand, Starvation occurs when a 
process waits for an indefinite period of time to get the resource it requires.
Another name for deadlock is Circular Waiting . Another name for starvation is Lived lock .
When deadlock occurs no process can make progress, while in starvation apart from the victim
process other processes can progress or proceed.

A semaphore is a signaling mechanism 

A race condition occurs in a multi-threaded or multi-process system when multiple threads/processes access and modify shared 
resources concurrently, leading to unpredictable or incorrect behavior. 

How to Prevent Race Conditions
Use Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)
Semaphores:


Deadlock	Circular wait due to improper resource handling.	
Use timeouts, resource ordering, preemption.
