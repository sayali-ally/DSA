1. Database Scaling
Since you're using PostgreSQL (SQL database), we need to handle both read and write scalability.

A. Sharding (Partitioning the Database)
Why? A single database can’t handle billions of rows efficiently.
How? We split data across multiple database instances.
Sharding Strategies:
By userId: Store user-related data in different shards.
By postId: Distribute posts across multiple shards.
By geographical region: Store data based on the user's location.
B. Replication (Read Scaling)
Why? Millions of users read the feed frequently.
How? Use read replicas.
The primary database handles writes (new posts, follows, likes).
Read replicas handle reads (fetching user feeds).



2. Feed Generation (Caching & Precomputing)
Fetching posts from followers in real-time is slow, so we optimize it.

A. Fan-out on Write (Precompute Feed)
When a user posts, we push it to their followers' feeds immediately.
Use Redis or Cassandra to store these precomputed feeds.
Faster feed fetching but high write costs.
B. Fan-out on Read (Fetch on Demand)
When a user opens their feed, we pull posts from the database dynamically.
Efficient for users with many followers but slower reads.
C. Hybrid Approach (Combination of Both)
For regular users → Use Fan-out on Write.
For celebrities (millions of followers) → Use Fan-out on Read.



3. Caching (Improve Performance)
Why? Fetching data from databases is slow.
How? Store frequently accessed data in Redis or Memcached.
Cache What?
User Feed → Cache recent posts for quick access.
Post Likes/Comments Count → Store aggregated counts in Redis.
Follower List → Store followers in Redis to reduce database queries.


4. Queueing System (Handling High Traffic)
Problem: When a post is created, it needs to be distributed to followers.
Solution: Use Kafka / RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing.
User posts something → Add to Kafka queue.
Workers read the queue and update the follower’s feeds asynchronously.



5. CDN for Image/Video Storage
Why? Storing images/videos in the database is inefficient.
Solution: Store media in AWS S3 / Google Cloud Storage and serve via CDN (Cloudflare, Akamai).
How? Users upload images → Stored in S3 → CDN delivers it to users fast.



6. Load Balancing
Why? Millions of requests need to be distributed across servers.
Solution: Use Load Balancers (Nginx, AWS ALB, HAProxy) to distribute traffic between:
API Servers
Database Servers
Cache Servers
Media Servers (CDN)



7. Handling Concurrency (Race Conditions)
Problem: Multiple users might like a post at the same time.
Solution: Use optimistic locking or atomic operations in the database.



Final System Architecture
Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js / Python (Django, Flask) / Java (Spring Boot)
Database: PostgreSQL (Sharded & Replicated)
Cache: Redis for fast retrieval
Queueing: Kafka / RabbitMQ
Storage: AWS S3 for images/videos
Load Balancer: Nginx / AWS ALB
CDN: Cloudflare / Akamai
Summary
✅ Sharding → Distribute data
✅ Replication → Scale reads
✅ Fan-out Strategies → Precompute feed
✅ Caching → Store frequently used data
✅ Queueing → Handle high traffic
✅ CDN → Optimize media delivery
✅ Load Balancing → Distribute requests

This setup ensures scalability, availability, and performance for millions of users.
