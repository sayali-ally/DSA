Instagram :
core features 
1. user should be able to scroll and view the feed page 
2. user should be able to post a story 
3. user should be able to view posts from followers 
4. user should be able to follow back and send friend request
5. user should be able to react and comment on a post 
6. chat via instagram chats 

non functional :
1. it should be scalable( support millions of read request)
2. it should be available ( over consistency)-> it is okay if data is stale or takes time to come in feed , but the app should always be available, no matter if the data is stale.
