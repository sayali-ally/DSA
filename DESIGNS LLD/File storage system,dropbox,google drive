File storage system 

Core features:
1. upload/download a file
2. delete a file
3. share a file 
4. organize files 
5. file versioning (track changes)

 Database Scaling
 A single SQL database (PostgreSQL, MySQL) can’t handle millions of users.
 File metadata (names, permissions, versions, etc.) grows exponentially.
 Sharding (Horizontal Scaling) → Split data across multiple database servers

 Storing actual files in a database is inefficient
 Use Object Storage like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
 Store only file metadata (name, size, owner, permissions) in the database.
 Store actual files in distributed storage like S3.

  Handling Large Files & Uploads
  Uploading large files (1GB+) at once might fail due to network issues.
  Solution: Chunked Uploads + Parallel Processing
  Chunked Uploads (Break large files into smaller parts)

Instead of processing uploads synchronously, use message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ
