Failure Handling in a Scalable File Storage System

Server Crashes (Application or Database Server)
Solution: Load Balancing & Replication

Use Multiple Servers behind a Load Balancer 
If one API server goes down, the Load Balancer redirects traffic to healthy servers.

Use Master-Slave Replication
If the Primary DB fails, a Replica takes over.
Sharding: If one shard fails, only a subset of users are affected, not the entire system.


Storage Failure (File Loss or Unavailability)
If an S3 bucket or file server is down, users canâ€™t download their files.
Solution: Replicated & Distributed Storage
Use Object Storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
Cloud storage automatically replicates files across data centers.


Network Failure (Slow or Lost Requests)
Solution: Retries & CDN Caching
Use a CDN (Cloudflare, Akamai)

File Upload Failure (Interrupted Uploads)
Solution: Chunked Uploads & Resume Support


High Traffic (Handling Millions of Requests)
Solution: Autoscaling & Queueing
Use Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

What if an Entire Data Center Fails?
Solution: Multi-Region Deployment
